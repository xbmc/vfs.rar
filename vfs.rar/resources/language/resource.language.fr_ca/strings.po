msgctxt "Addon Description"
msgid "This addon is an extraction utility for RAR archives.

It allows direct reading of uncompressed RAR files, so prior unpacking is not necessary. For all other types, it is temporarily unpacked and passed to Kodi.

Attention: A "Solid RAR" archive type requires complete unpacking to use files within it. Hence access times may be long for larger packages."

#[Consistency] Make terms, settings names, brands and other minutiae, consistent throughout file.
#[Capitalization] Avoid capitalizing every second word. See http://grammarist.com/capitalization/
#For example, prefer wording as "This new string" instead of "This New String".
#[Referencing] If a suitable string already exists, reuse it, making a note of where it's used!
#[Description / location] For example, "#. Description of some setting" used on "#: xbmc/addons/guidialogaddoninfo.cpp"
#When writing a description or setting, refer to a setting name in quotes. See existing entries for guidance.
#For example, "Press \"OK\" for \"All seasons\"" instead of "Press OK for All seasons" after first word.
